iupiBooks
=======================================================

This webapp acts as an online used book store for students in the UPR system. Because this is a test, it was designed specifically for students enrolled in the Rio Piedras campus. Using this system, students will be able to circumvent unreliable Facebook groups and fliers on campus in lieu of this familiar, Ebay-esque interface.
